**Due to 2.208 integrating CBF into the game, this mod will not be recieving any updates as it serves little purpose, including a 2.208x / Geode 5.0.0 port. You may still use this mod for 2.207x versions.**

# CBF Gamemode Toggle

This mod simplifies the process of switching cbf modes between classic mode and platformer modes. Useful if you play both modes and sometimes forget to switch between leaderboard allowed settings (as CBF in platformer is widely considered an unfair advantage)

By default, CBF is enabled for classic and disabled for platformer. You can choose between CBF, COS, and No CBF in this mod's settings (which also includes an overall editor toggle as well if anybody would find that useful)

## known issues:
Currently this mod is desynced from Mega Hack v9's cbf toggler. The mod does alter the CBF mode, however, Mega Hack's UI just doesn't show it.
