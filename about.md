# CBF Gamemode Toggle

This mod simplifies the process of switching cbf modes between classic mode and platformer modes. Useful if you play both modes and sometimes forget to switch between leaderboard around settings (as CBF in platformer is widely considered an unfair advantage)

By default, CBF is enabled for classic and disabled for platformer. You can choose between CBF, COS, and No CBF in this mod's settings (which also includes an overall editor toggle aswell if anybody would find that useful)
